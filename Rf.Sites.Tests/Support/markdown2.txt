Sai,  
I am really out of NInject these days. 
For StructureMap, I would probably put something like that into the DI configuration in order to get a session:

    For<ISession>()
      .Use(ctx=>ctx.GetInstance<ISessionFactory>()
      .GetCurrentSession());

You have to let yourself guide by the API what the requirements are in NInject to provide some 
_factory method_.
